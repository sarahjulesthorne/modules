# Modules  
### Description  
The project is an introduction to the use of modules.  
We practiced using getter functions to pass information securely to other functions within the same module and other modules in the app.  
We also practiced importing and exporting functions and objects.  
We created a store app which used click events to build a cart and product display and to tell the user the total price of their final purchase.
